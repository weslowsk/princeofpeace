<h1>VBS 2021 - God's Wonder Lab</h1>

<p>We are forging ahead with our plans to hold a Virtual VBS.
The theme verse, Psalm 98:1, “He has done marvelous things!”, shares a word of hope and trust - Jesus does the impossible for us! 
</p>

<br/>

<h2>Virtual VBS</h2>
<p>
    Virtual VBS takes place via Zoom on July 20, 21, 22 from 9am-11:15am for children from 3 years old to those currently in Grade 5.
    A fee of $10/child or $15/family will offset some of the costs, with the church covering the rest. 
</p>

<br/>

<h2>Preparations and Provisions</h2>
<p>
    A Top-notch team of leaders are prepping - Tom our Storyteller, Kierstin our Musician, Pastor our Spiritual Guide, Shelley our Craftswoman, Jane and Sandy our scientists, Tina our games guru, and more.

    We will provide the following:
    <ul>
        <li>Zoom link for each day’s message, games and crafts, etc.</li>
        <li>Craft Kit with material for each day (to be distributed prior to July 20)</li>
        <li>Lesson leaflet for the younger students (to be distributed with craft kit)</li>
        <li>Prayer covering our leaders, families and students to know that Jesus does the impossible for us.</li>
    </ul>
