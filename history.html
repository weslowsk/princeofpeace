<h2>Highlights of Prince of Peace’s History</h2>
<p>
The District Mission Department purchased the church site in December 1979 for “The Lutheran Mission of Northwest Regina.”  Pastor Ron Raedeke was called as the founding Pastor.
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
There are many more historical highlights since, we have new programs, finishing the outside with bricks, signs, Cornerstone Dedication, installation of Stained Glass, etc.
<br/>
Throughout the history of the congregation many groups have met numerous times and sponsored many projects and activities.  Some of the various groups and activities have included the Lutheran Women’s Missionary League, College and Career Group, the Great Achievers, various Choirs, various Bible Study classes, Youth groups, Stephens Ministry, Christian Preschool, Mom’s and Babys Nursery, Whist Group, Polka Praise, Women’s Brunches, Partners in Prayer, Outreach events, Ball Teams, Floats in the Santa Clause Parade, and so many more.
<br/>
Though there have been many changes, there has been one constant element, the foundation of God.  We thank you, Lord, for our Pastors, leaders, and church families and for the opportunity to gather together to hear the Good News of your love for us, freely given through Christ your Son.
