<h1>Children</h1>
<p>Jesus welcomed children to himself. So do we!
The presence of children is a gift to the church. We rejoice that they have come to receive eternal blessings from their Saviour.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Sunday School</h2>

<p>Sunday School is held Sundays at 10am for children ages 4 through grade 6.
All children are invited to attend. Children begin their Sunday in worship with their family and move to Sunday School after the children's lesson.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Vacation Bible School (VBS)</h2>

<p>This special ministry takes place every summer, typically in July.
We select a program that will help children come to and grow closer to Jesus, their friend and Saviour.
The program typically includes: fun and endearing music, crafts, games, Bible stories and snacks.
Some recent past themes have included: God's Living Water, Rainforest Explorer and God's Wonder Lab.
This program is enjoyed by many children each year.</p>
<br/>
<h1>Students</h1>
<h2>Confirmation</h2>

<p>Instruction for teens to learn the key teachings of the Lutheran faith. For example, the Ten Commandments, the Apostles' Creed, Lord's Prayer, and their meanings.</p>
<br/>
<h1>Adults</h1>
<h2>Bible Studies</h2>
<p>Regular Bible studies on various topics are ongoing.</p>
<br/>

<h2>Women's Bible Studies</h2>
<p>Include monthly topical studies on Tuesday afternoons. Cottage studies (held in members' homes) as well as retreats are held periodically.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Men's Group</h2>

<p>Meet monthly for a Saturday Bible study and then typically go out for brunch and fellowship.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Adult Faith Instruction</h2>

<p>Offered for adults to learn key beliefs of the Lutheran Church prior to communicant membership.</p>
<br/>
<h1>Other Ministries</h1>
<h2>Outreach Initiatives</h2>
<p>We complete many different projects to share The Good News of Jesus and to help our neighbours.
Some examples include delivering Easter egg invites to our Easter services, adopting families in need at Christmas, and helping refugees settle in Regina.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Fellowship and Family Events</h2>
<p>Varied opportunities exist to have fun and to meet others in our church family. Events include potluck meals, guest speakers, women's brunches, and paint nights.</p>
