<h1>Offering Options</h1>

<p>
    The Covid-19 pandemic has affected all of us in one way or another, and Prince of Peace Lutheran Church is certainly not immune to these difficult times.  While the giving of an offering can easily be seen merely as necessary to “pay the bills”, as Christian stewards (managers) we view our offering as an act of worship and a means by which we express our gratitude to God for what he has given us, especially in His Son, returning to Him a portion of what is really already His anyway, but that He has entrusted to us. To help maintain the operations of the Church there are several options available for your generous offerings.
