<h1>What We Believe</h1>
<br/>
<h2>We Believe:</h2>
<br/>
<ul class="full-page">
    <li>That God is three persons (Father, Son and Holy Spirit) in one God.</li>
    <li>That the Father has created us and all that exists. "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth." Gen. 1:1.</li>
    <li>That sin separates us from God and results in death. "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." Rom. 3:23;
        The wages of sin is death." Rom. 6:23.</li>
    <li>That Jesus Christ, God’s Son, died on the cross to forgive our sins, rose again to defeat death, and has made it possible
        for us to enjoy eternal life with God. "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes
        in him should not perish but have eternal life." John 3:16.</li>
    <li>That the Holy Spirit brings us to faith in Christ and keeps us believing in Him.</li>
    <li>That God distributes His forgiveness through special means known as the "Means of Grace" (Baptism, The Lord’s Supper
        and the Word of God).</li>
    <li>That we respond to God’s free gift of love by making it our aim to serve and love God and others. "We love because he
        first loved us." 1 John 4:19.</li>
</ul>

<p class="center"><i>"For me, being a part of the Prince of Peace family is really a way of life.
    I am embraced in God’s love through the Pastor’s faithful preaching and teaching of God’s word and by my receiving God’s sacraments.
    I feel that I am growing in my faith through attendance at worship and Bible studies.
    We reach out to one another here with kindness and there is a feeling of genuine love and caring for each other as we work in service to our Lord."</i></p>
