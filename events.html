We are collecting food for the Regina Foodbank throughout October. Members are also encouraged to consider a monetary donation directly to the Foodbank. While you are welcome to bring all types of food donations, we encourage you to bring a box of cereal as party of your donation. Sunday School children and those attending our fun day on September 27th are also bringing cereal. Then on October 20th, after the Sunday Service, we will have a domino shape of cereal boxes downstairs we will "tumble". Thank you in anticipation!
